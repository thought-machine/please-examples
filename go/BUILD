# A go_library is a collection of Go files compiled into one package.
# Typically you'd have one of these per directory, corresponding to the
# Go package structure. Please doesn't fundamentally require that you obey
# that structure but if you don't there's a reasonable chance of running
# afoul of obtuse compiler errors.
